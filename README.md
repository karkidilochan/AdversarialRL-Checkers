# **Reinforcement Learning Agent for Checkers Using Adversarial Neural Networks 🏆🧠**

This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent** capable of playing **Checkers** using **Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs)**. The agent learns optimal strategies through iterative training, leveraging deep learning techniques to approximate state-action values.

---

## **Project Overview 🎯**
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables autonomous agents to **make decisions, learn optimal policies, and maximize rewards** through interaction with an environment. This project focuses on:
- Developing an **RL agent** to play **8×8 American Checkers**.
- Using **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to approximate Q-values.
- Training the agent via **iterative self-play** to maximize its **win rate**.

### **Core RL Components:**
1. **Agent** – The checkers-playing AI.
2. **Actions** – Moves made on the board.
3. **Environment** – The game of Checkers.
4. **Rewards** – Feedback from winning, losing, or achieving favorable board positions.

## **Game Representation & Modeling 🎲**
### **Checkers Board Representation**
- The game is modeled using an **8×8 matrix** where each cell represents a piece:
  - **Men (regular pieces)**: Can move diagonally forward.
  - **Kings**: Can move diagonally in both directions.
  - **Captured pieces**: Are removed from the board.
- A **compressed 32×1 array** is used to store only relevant board positions.

### **State, Actions & Rewards in RL**
- **States**: Represent the board position at any given time.
- **Actions**: Possible moves available for a player.
- **Rewards**: Positive for capturing pieces and winning, negative for poor moves.

## **Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach 🤖**
### **1. Neural Network-Based Q-Learning**
Traditional Q-learning requires a **Q-table**, which is impractical due to Checkers' vast state space. Instead, a **neural network approximates Q-values** to predict the best action for a given board state.

### **2. Bellman Equation for Q-Function Update**
The agent updates Q-values iteratively using:

\[
Q_{new}(s_t,a_t) = Q_{old}(s_t,a_t) + \alpha [ R(s_t) + \gamma \cdot \max_a Q(s_{t+1}, a) - Q_{old}(s_t,a_t)]
\]

Where:
- \( \alpha \) = Learning rate  
- \( \gamma \) = Discount factor  
- \( Q(s,a) \) = Action-value function estimating future rewards.

### **3. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Training**
- A **Generative Model (`gen_model`)** learns to generate board states.
- A **Discriminative Model (`board_model`)** evaluates whether a board position is real or generated.
- The **adversarial training** refines the ability of the RL agent to distinguish optimal moves.

## **Implementation Details ⚙️**
### **Metrics for Board Evaluation**
A **custom heuristic function** evaluates board positions using:
- Number of **captured pieces**.
- Number of **potential moves**.
- Number of **men vs. kings**.
- Number of **safe and vulnerable pieces**.
- Positional advantage on the board.

### **Training Pipeline 🏋️**
1. **Initialize Agent** with a neural network-based Q-function.
2. **Self-play** to explore different board states.
3. **Update Q-values** using the **Bellman Equation**.
4. **Adversarial Training** refines the agent’s decision-making.
5. **Evaluate performance** using **win rate metrics**.
